# Spending App Challenge

Thanks for your interest in joining our team. The purpose of this challenge is to replicate a real-world working environment and to test a diverse set of skills, to see how you would work with us on our team. The challenge itself is similar to the work you would be doing on our team.

Below is some high level detail about the project. Good luck!

## Language & Tools

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - compatible with any version between v12 and v19
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - as a package manager
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - client-side framework
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - server-side framework

## Quickstart

This section contains all the information required for getting the server up and running. The application contains the following two directories:

- [server/](server/) - the server directory that contains the server code
- [client/](client/) - the client directory that contains the client code

In order to run the application, you will need to have both the server and client running in separate terminals.

### Server

To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the server directory (in Unix that would be `cd server`)

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Seed Data

(Optional) This will re-populate the database with data closer to-date

```bash
npm run seed
```

4. Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

### Client

To run the client, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the client directory (in Unix that would be `cd client`)

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the client

```bash
ng serve
```

## Formatting Client

To format your code using [prettier](https://prettier.io/), follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the client directory (in Unix that would be `cd client`)

2. Run this command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To ensure you are using the correct version of prettier, make sure to format your code after installing the dependencies (`npm install`).

## Verify That Everything Is Set Up Correctly

To verify that the frontend is working properly, go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). You should see the homepage that is titled "Welcome to My Spending App" and a chart as below. _Note the chart styling may be different as this was rendered using a React charting library._
